#Notes#


This project is an exploration of one aspect of a much larger project.

This particular test focusses on creating an event and displaying it using the FullCalendar jQuery project.

I spent a long time looking for a date/time select widget. Trent Richardson's addon to the jQueryUI dateselect finally fit the bill.

Please refer the the "recipe.md" document in the "notes" directory for detailed information about how this project was developed.
